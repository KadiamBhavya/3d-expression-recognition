# 3d-expression-recognition
This project performs 3D facial expression recognition using machine learning (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree) on BU-4DFE facial landmark data. It includes data preprocessing (translation, rotation), 10-fold cross-validation, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
